# SQL vs NoSql

## SQL

- stores data in tables
- single data entry is ROW or RECORD
- individual categorys are called COLUMNS

## NoSql

- stores data in COLLECTIONS and not tables
- single entry is a DOCUMENT
- individual categorys are called FIELDS

```javascript
// COLLECTION - similar to table in sql
[
    // DOCUMENT - similar to row/record in sql
    {
        "id" : 'e123', // FIELD - similar to collumn in sql
        "name" : "Dave"
        "email" : "dave@gmail.com"
    }
]

```
